# Water-level-Sensor
Water level sensor is used to measure water level in water tank or in any other equipment. In our daily life we need to detect the level of water like in water tank at the top of roof which is not directly accessible and in laboratories where specific level of any liquid is required to be monitored. In such applications water level sensor is very useful.
how to interface water level sensor with Arduino and how to monitor specific water level using this assembly. Water level sensor gives output int the form of voltage.So before using water level sensor, one should know, how to meausre analog voltage using Arduino

Another Arduino project I made in our dept where I programmed the Arduino 
   to detect the water level in any container.
